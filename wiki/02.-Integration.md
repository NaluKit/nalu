See [#9](https://github.com/NaluKit/nalu/issues/9) for current status before downloading the dependencies.

## Maven
Working with Maven, you need to add the following maven dependency:
```XML
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.nalukit.nalu</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.nalukit.nalu</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-processor</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
```
Depending on the widget library your project is using, you have to add another dependency.

### Elemental2 based widget libraries
In case the project is using a widget library based on elemental2 or elemento or the project is using a library like [Domino-UI](https://github.com/DominoKit/domino-ui), add the following dependency to your pom:
```XML
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.nalukit.nalu</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-plugin-elemental2</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
```

### Using GWT Widget
In case the project is based on GWT widgets, add the following plugin to your pom:
```XML
   <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.nalukit.nalu</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-plugin-gwt</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.nalukit.nalu</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-plugin-gwt-processor</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
```

**Nalu is available on Maven central.**

## Requirements

At the moment Nalu requires at least Java 17 and GWT 2.12.2. We recommend to use always the latest version GWT.

You need to add the following maven dependency:
```XML
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.nalukit.nalu</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.nalukit.nalu</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-processor</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
