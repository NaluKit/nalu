# Welcome to the Nalu wiki!

Inside the wiki you will find a lot of useful information about Nalu.

If you have any questions about the framework, please use the [Nalu Gitter room](https://gitter.im/NaluKit42/lobby).

The current version of Nalu works with Java 11 & 17 and is tested with the latest GWT version.
