# Getting started
To use Nalu in your project you have to do these basic steps.


## Module Descriptor
### GWT 2
First we need to tell GWT to use the Nalu module. To do so, insert the Nalu module into your module descriptor:
```XML
  <inherits name='com.github.nalukit.nalu.Nalu'/>
```
Depending on the widget lib your are using inside your project, you need to add one of the following lines:

* in case working with a Elemental2 based widget lib (for example: Elemento, Domino-UI) use:
```XML
  <inherits name='com.github.nalukit.nalu.plugin.elemental2.NaluPluginElemental2'/>
```

* in case working with a GWT widget based library (for example: native GWT, Sencha GXT, Smart-GWT) use:
```XML
  <inherits name='com.github.nalukit.nalu.plugin.gwt.NaluPluginGWT'/>
```

Last but not least, we need to set up the entry point of opur application:
```XML
  <entrypoint class='[path to your entrypoint]'/>
````

## Entrypoint
### GWT 2
First we need to implement the `EntryPoint`. A entry point in Nalu looks like that:
```Java
public class Application
    implements EntryPoint {

  public void onModuleLoad() {
    // Create the application.
    // The ApplicationImpl-class
    // will be generated by the framework.
    MyApplication application = new MyApplicationImpl();
    // start the application by calling the run()-method.
    application.run(new NaluPluginGWT());
  }
}
```
Wenn using this code, you will recognize that `MyApplication` and `MyApplicationImpl` is marked as error, case the classes do not exist. This is correct. We will discuss the `MyApplication`-class next and the `MyApplicationImpl`-class will be created, once you build your project.

#### Note
There is a pitfall: the `run`-method requires a Nalu plugin.

* in case working with a Elemental2 based widget lib (for example: Elemento, Domino-UI) use:
`application.run(new NaluPluginElemental2());`

* in case working with a GWT widget based library (for example: native GWT, Sencha GXT, Smart-GWT) use:
`application.run(new NaluPluginGWT());`

**Choosing the right plugin is essential!**
