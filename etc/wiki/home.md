# Welcome to the Nalu wiki!

Inside the wiki you will find a lot of useful informations about Nalu.

If you have any questions about the framework, please use the [Nalu Gitter room](https://gitter.im/NaluKit42/lobby).

The current version of Nalu uses Java 8 and is tested with the latest GWT version.

## Nalu Project Generator
To start using Nalu just create a new project [here](http://www.mvp4g.org/gwt-boot-starter-nalu/GwtBootStarterNalu.html). Once you pressed the 'generate'-button, download and unzip the zip file and import the project into your IDE.

### Examples
